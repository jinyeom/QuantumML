    "Let us consider coin flipping. With two possible outcomes, the probability of heads $p_0$ and that of tails $p_1$ sum up to $1$. This probability distribution can also be represented as a column stochastic vector $\\vec{p} = \\begin{bmatrix} p_0 \\\\ p_1 \\end{bmatrix}$, where $\\left\\lVert\\vec{p}\\right\\rVert_1 = 1$. In this case of classical probability theory, both $p_0$ and $p_1$ are constrained to be non-negative real number. Additionally, the **entropy** of a probability distribution measures its unpredictability; it is defined as $H = -\\sum_i{P_i \\log{P_i}}$."

This simplest possible quantum state with two possible outcomes is often refered to as a **qubit**."

    "Quantum **superposition** states that any two (or more) quantum states can be added together (\"superposed\") and the result will be another valid quantum state. Note that this is not the same as simply not knowing in which state a qubit is in; rather, superposition states that its state is a linear combination of the two possible states, and once its state is observed is when its state **collapses (wave function collapse)** to a single deterministic state.
